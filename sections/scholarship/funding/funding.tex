\caption{\label{tab:fund} A summary of funding for research projects already received, and (below double line) future planned grant applications.  Projects above the double line help build toward successful applications below the double line. Internal Whittier College grants (Faculty Development and Send, Learn, Return) helped fund attendance to the American Association of Physics Teachers Conference for New Professors.  The DigLibArts grant has helped begin The Primer project.  I plan on attempting each of the two grants below the double line within the next two years.  For the NSF CAREER grant, my sub-field of UHE neutrinos has had a nice track record, with three awards in the last decade.}
\end{table}

In Tab. \ref{tab:fund}, I outline the grants I have already received\footnote{The AAPT conference described in the table is listed here: \url{http://www.aapt.org/Conferences/newfaculty/nfw.cfm}}, and plan to submit.  The purpose of this listing is to demonstrate my drive to build an externally funded NSF-based research program.  I have the advantage of being at Whittier College, for which the NSF gives special grant-writing status to detail how our research has ``broader impacts'' for the surrounding community.  Projects such as The Primer, and participation in the Artemis program I've carefully chosen to demonstrate to the NSF my willingness to make an impact on the community.  Thus far, I have received internal grants from Whittier College.  However, these contributions to my startup funding as a professor help me seed projects that ultimately benefit the college, in that I can use the progress to build towards larger proposals.
