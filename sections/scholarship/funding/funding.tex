\caption{\label{tab:fund} A summary of funding for research projects already received, and (below double line) future planned grant applications.  Projects above the double line help build toward successful applications below the double line. Internal Whittier College grants (Faculty Development and Send, Learn, Return) helped fund attendance to the American Association of Physics Teachers Conference for New Professors.  The DigLibArts grant has helped begin The Primer project.  I plan on attempting each of the two grants below the double line within the next two years.  For the NSF CAREER grant, my sub-field of UHE neutrinos has had a nice track record, with three awards in the last decade.}

In Tab. \ref{tab:fund}, I outline the grants I have already received\footnote{The AAPT conference described in the table is listed here: \url{http://www.aapt.org/Conferences/newfaculty/nfw.cfm}}, and plan to submit.  The purpose of this listing is to demonstrate my drive to build an externally funded NSF-based research program.  I have the advantage of being at Whittier College, for which the NSF gives special grant-writing status to detail how our research has ``broader impacts'' for the surrounding community.  Projects such as The Primer, and participation in the Artemis program I've carefully chosen to demonstrate to the NSF my willingness to make an impact on the community.  Thus far, I have received internal grants from Whittier College, and a startup grant provided by both the Office of the Dean of the Faculty, and the Department of Physics and Astronomy.  These two contributions to my startup funding as a professor help me seed projects that ultimately benefit the college, in that I can use the progress to build towards larger proposals.  \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

\textbf{When I joined Whittier College, I was awarded a start-up grant totaling \$30,000, and I am grateful for the opportunity to use these resources to expand our STEM abilities at Whittier for educational and research purposes.}  The Office of the Dean of the Faculty contributed \$10,000 to this startup grant, and the Department of Physics and Astronomy contributed \$20,000.  I am the first professor to teach firmware here, and my students have begun to learn this crucial engineering skill.  I have used these resources from the Office of the Dean and my department to create a lab which has introduced firmware to Whittier College, made progress for ARA/ARIANNA, placing Whittier College firmly within a new field of research.

\caption{\label{tab:fund2} The startup grant awarded to me upon joining the Whittier community came from the Dean of the Faculty (33\%) and the Department of Physics and Astronomy (67\%).  The FPGA-based projects are made possible by the mixed-domain oscilloscope (meaning digital and analogue signals) and the Xilinx hardware and software.  As mentioned above, these projects are important for creating UHE neutrino detectors build with Xilinx firmware.  The MDO bandwidth is restricted to 200 MHz, but \textit{upgradable} to 1GHz if it becomes necessary scientifically.  I felt it was an economical first step, as the pure 1GHz units can cost up to \$20,000.  The upgrade to the higher bandwidth would facilitate my future research, but would cost only a few thousand dollars extra.}
