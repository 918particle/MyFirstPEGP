Astroparticle physics is simply the combination of \textit{astrophysics} and \textit{particle physics.}  The study of astrophysics may be further subdivided into observational astronomy, which is the study of the origin and phenomenology of celestial objects, and the physics of celestial objects themselves.  The former is based on observations from telescopes sentitive to various parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the latter involves topics like special relativity, general relativity and cosmology.  Particle physics involves the study of atoms and photons, electrons and nuclei, and the quantum field theory (QFT) that governs all sub-atomic particles.  Beginning with formative discoveries in 1911, the main sub-field at the juncture between astrophysics and particle physics has been the study of \textit{cosmic rays}. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Cosmic rays are UHE nuclei, photons, electrons, and neutrinos that arrive at Earth from deep space.  Particle physics data suggests that the fundamental forces in nature unify under one QFT as the particle energy increases, and the particle speed approaches the speed of light.  Before humans could accelerate sub-atomic particles to such energies, we studied them exclusively in the form of cosmic rays.  The Nobel prize-winning discoveries of cosmic radiation, antimatter, the cloud chamber, the muon (a heavier version of an electron), quantum neutrino oscillations and solar neutrinos, and gravitational waves have all come from a sub-field that evolved from cosmic-ray physics into what we now call \textit{astroparticle physics}, or \textit{multi-messenger astronomy}. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Owing to its remote location and isolation, the excellent transparency of ice at wavelengths ranging from optical through radio, and the presence of extensive scientific support at research bases, \textbf{Antarctica} now supports many astroparticle physics projects.  Within the last five years,  the IceCube experiment, sensitive to optical and near-optical Cherenkov radiation resulting from neutrino interactions in ice, has reported on the first observation of extraterrestrial neutrinos at world-record energies \cite{Aartsen:2016xlq}.  In-ice detection of RF radiation is a more efficient strategy at neutrino energies 1000 times higher than those observed at IceCube. This strategy arrises from the combination of the Askaryan effect \cite{Askaryan:1962hbi,1962JPSJS..17C.257A,1965JETP...21..658A} and the observation that RF pulses propagate for kilometers in ice \cite{barrella_barwick_saltzberg_2011,barwick_besson_gorham_saltzberg_2005}.  The Askaryan effect occurs when a UHE particle interacts in solid matter, creates a cascade of new particles that radiate RF pulses.  Pioneering efforts to capture UHE neutrinos originating from beyond the solar system via the Askaryan effect have been undertaken in Antarctica \cite{Allison:2015eky,Barwick:2014pca,Gorham:2008dv,Kravchenko:2001id}.  Two of these are the Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) and the Antarctic Ross Ice Shelf Antenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA).  My research focuses on combining the best of ARA/ARIANNA, and achieving world-record breaking UHE neutrino observations.

\subsection{Recent Peer-Reviewed Publications, with Brief Descriptions}

Below is a selection of seven \textit{recent} peer-reviewed publications in this field, in reverse chronological order.  I indicate in the list the papers for which I was the  \textit{corresponding author} with an asterisk (*).  In the fields of particle and astrophysics, the corresponding author is the author who officially submits the work for publication.  We also have a policy of strict alphabetical author listing, in order to recognize the contributions of all team members, even if they did not contribute to a particular paper.  This style often runs counter to the expectations of researchers in other fields accustomed to reading the ``first author'' as the main contributor.  I have averaged one peer-reviewed journal article for which I was the corresponding author per year since I graduated from UCI in 2013. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

The purpose of the list is two-fold.  First, I must demonstrate that I am committed to research excellence and that my research reaches out from Whittier College to the world of astroparticle physics.  Second, I provide the list as evidence that I have begun to involve Whittier undergraduates in my research program. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}
