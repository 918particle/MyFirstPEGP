\section{Background}

My name is Jordan Hanson, and I am formally submitting my first Professional Evaluation and Growth Plan (PEGP).  As required by Whittier College, and in accordance with the regulations in the Whittier College Faculty handbook, the material herein pertains to my first complete academic year as a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy.  I have included this professional introduction for those readers to whom I have not yet been introduced.  I look forward to meeting and working with my colleagues in other departments over the years, and I hope that this brief introduction will both explain why I chose to become a professor, and share my vision for teaching and scholarship in the area of \textit{astroparticle physics} at Whittier College. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

My professors and colleagues in the professional-track physics program at Yale University inspired me to excel beyond what I thought was possible for myself.  I was introduced to the world of academic scholarship by outstanding faculty, and I fell in love with physics.  The beauty of physics is found in its theoretical simplicity, and the surge of excitement as observations spark to life.  After receiving my Bachelor of Science degree, I joined the community of UC Irvine, the home of the Nobel Laureate who made the first observation of a sub-atomic particle called a neutrino.  UC Irvine excels in the study of extrasolar, high-energy sub-atomic particles: \textit{astroparticle physics.}  At UCI I was introduced to Professors Steve Barwick and Stuart Kleinfelder.  Dr. Barwick is a professor of physics in the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and Dr. Kleinfelder is a professor of physics in the Department of Electrical Engineering.  Together we embarked on a journey to produce world record-breaking observations of high-energy neutrinos from beyond the solar system. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

UC Irvine served as a training ground for my ability to teach, and there I first witnessed the flash of light in a student's eyes.  I taught as an assistant under Dr. Barwick, serving students in sections associated with introductory physics courses.  During the early semesters in my graduate career, I was teaching physics sections of twenty students each for five continuous hours, three days per week.  After concluding my teaching duties, I focused on research for several years.  Upon receiving my doctorate, I solo-taught an introductory physics course during one of my post-doctoral fellowships, learning the difference between \textit{teaching} a course and \textit{creating} a course.  I enjoy creating new courses, and I have already created and taught new courses for students at Whittier.  Above all else, I hope my work at Whittier will \textit{enlighten} our students.

\section{General Reflection and Future Directions}

Any general reflection for academics at Whittier must begin and end with the students.  Over the past year and a half, I have chosen to become an \textit{active participant in this community} and to push beyond what is required of me as a young professor.  I have taught introductory physics courses to students who have no prior experience in physics, and created a new advanced computer science course.  I've attended conferences to improve and expand my teaching methods, taking advantage of the broad research in physics education.  I took a course from a professor in another department for the shear joy of learning, but also to learn methods from an experienced teacher.  I've involved students in all facets of my research, including software and algorithm development, firmware development, building hardware, and digital storytelling.  Two of these students won Keck Fellowships while working in my laboratory.  We are preparing to become part of a collaboration of researchers who plan to build a world-class astroparticle detector at the South Pole.  Additionally, I've become a mentor and advisor to a student organization, and served in a tenure-track faculty search.  Each action I've taken during these past months has been geared towards serving our students thoughtfully and rigorously, to provide them with a quality education and research environment. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Despite these accomplishments, I am not yet satisfied with some aspects of my teaching.  I was surprised to find that in my introductory courses, a group of students felt that the level of technical detail was presented too rapidly and too advanced.  A group of students has been vocal in their assessment of these issues, and I take them seriously.  Some of my students in an introductory course actively helped me with these issues.  It is my hope that in the coming years, I will be able to implement a pace and difficulty level suitable for the academic environment at Whittier that \textit{does the most good, for the largest number of students}.  Although it is not right to omit core physics principles from introductory courses, I will rely on the past experiences of my department to find a solution.  My hypothesis is that some students in introductory courses are not prepared to make logical abstractions, requiring a larger number of concrete examples before gaining that ability.  I will work diligently to boost the abstract problem-solving ability of my students through leading by example.
