Tables \ref{tab:courses:adv_eval_1} and \ref{tab:courses:adv_eval_2} show the results of my advanced computer science and physics course.  The results show a similar correlation as the introductory courses (see Fig. \ref{fig:ag_data2}).   For the lower scores, the fractional error is about 50\%, whereas the higher scores have fractional error of about 20\%.  The correlation is not as strong as the introductory courses, because the sample size is smaller. These numbers do inform the analysis of my teaching of digital design, however the students' remarks in the evaluations provide more detail. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Some students remarked that the course did not seem adequately structured or prepared.  This was in large part caused by the disruption of not having the equipment I needed.  Although I did order the textbooks and digital components long before the first day of class, the company shipping the parts refused to accept our department check, wanting a credit card.  I had chosen a standard electronics textbook and lab companion book written by professors at MIT\footnote{\textit{The Art of Electronics, 3rd Ed.}, Horowitz and Hill. Cambridge University Press (2017).} which assumed we would have the parts. Upon hearing that the parts would be delayed, I was forced to revert to an alternative textbook a colleague provided me\footnote{\textit{Digital Fundamentals, 8th Ed.}, Floyd.  Pearson Education (2003).}. This text was excellent for demonstrations of binary math and boolean algebra, but was lighter on hardware. The students were unhappy that the textbooks they bought would not be used until later in the course. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

We now have the reusable digital components stored in the physics labs, so we will be able to integrate the lab and lecture activities and use free instructor desk copies of the MIT text I obtained.  Also, this will allow me to do what I originally planned, which was to organize the course by \textit{sub-topic} rather than simply doing all the mathematics first.  This should raise the students' assessment of categories like course preparation and effective use of class time.  Finally, having experienced once how long it takes students to assemble circuits, I can better plan future class times.  Students remarked that the super heterodyne AM radio took too long to assemble, for example.  In the future, those projects could be partially completed by me first, before allowing the students to finish them. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Some students remarked that they felt underprepared for the course material.  I did notice that I had two Whittier Scholar Program majors (F. Capraro, and A. Dodds), and while one felt the course was easy and appeared comfortable with the material, the other did not.  Nevertheless, I was pleased to have those students and would like to encourage WSP enrollment in the future.  The others were either 3-2 engineering or mathematics majors, and some felt that they did not remember enough physics to understand some sub-topics (resistors, capacitors, and transistors, for example).  I had a tough decision regarding the pre-requisites for the course, which are normally introductory-level physics and computer science courses.  My department and I felt that in the course's inaugural year that I should be able to waive the pre-requisites on a case-by-case basis in order to gain more students.  I promoted COSC330 in my PHYS150 and PHYS180 courses, and students who felt they could handle it approached me personally and asked to take it. It turned out to be the mathematics seniors who did not remember enough physics and struggled with circuit-based topics.  In the future, I plan to review circuit analysis in more detail, before adding digital elements. \\ \hspace{0.1cm}

Note: this does not have to live in the final version. \textit{Finally, I must admit that I need more experience and training in classroom management.  One of my students demonstrated behavioral problems.  These included the following: persistent tardiness, sending inappropriate or disrespectful emails, not doing a fair share of group work, and complaining strongly about grades.  This student even wrote \textit{on a midterm exam} that the midterm was not fair, rather than spending time working the problem.  The student remarked that even the student evaluation form was flawed.  Finally, the student challenged my grading and submitted a grade appeal, all the while sending me aggressive emails over summer 2018.  For the future, I'd like to work on my ability to handle difficult students and inspire them to be positive, and to focus on the work.}
